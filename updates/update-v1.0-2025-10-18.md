## ðŸ’­ Reflections

The breakthrough moment came when we realized this wasn't just a toolâ€”it was an operating system. By combining Warp's visual capabilities, Raycast's keyboard-driven launcher, and modular bash scripts, we've created something that feels like an extension of the mind.

This is not a product. This is a toolkit. This is your OS.
